# Kerbal-Star-Systems-2 [3.0.1]

Kerbal Star Systems 2 (KSS2) is a large-scale interstellar mod for Kerbal Space Program, expanding the game far beyond the Kerbol system with a collection of detailed star systems, ranging from realistic exoplanets to fully fictional cosmic wonders.

As the spiritual successor to kerbal Star Systems 1 and Galaxies Unbound, KSS2 brings both scientific grounding and creative worldbuilding together in one of the most ambitious projects the KSP modding scene has seen. Its reputation has sparked plenty of discussion, but few deny the scale and depth it brings to the game.

Compatibility information and installation instructions can be found below.

## Key Features:
- **Realistic Stellar Systems**: Features a mixture of real-life astronomy and fictional systems.
- **Increased Scale**: Expands on previous planetary packs, giving players more environments to explore.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: With its extensive system additions, the mod transforms the KSP experience into a more complex and immersive space simulation.

## Installation Guide:
### 1. Downloading KSS2:
Before installing **KSS2 v3.0**, ensure that previous versions of KSS2 are removed from your GameData directory. This version is **incompatible** with *Galaxies Unbound* (GU) and older KSS2 versions (1.x), and may cause the game to crash or fail to load.

**Steps to Install**:
1. **Download KSS2** from [GitHub](https://github.com/StarCrusher96/Kerbal-Star-Systems-2/releases).
2. Extract the following into your **GameData** directory:
   - KSS2_Core.2.0.zip
   - Desired KSS2 system(s) (e.g., SystemAethera, SystemAlphaCentauri, SystemLuhman16, )
   - **Optional**: If you want to use contracts, download and extract *ContractPack.2.0.zip*.
3. **Volumetric EVE** is supported by KSS2 for enhanced visuals (Legacy EVE is not compatible).

Your **KSS2** folder should look like this:
	
		|- KSS2
			|- ContractPack
			|- Core
			|- SystemAethera
			|- SystemAlphaCentauri
			|- SystemLuhman16
			|- KSS2_License.md

   - Parallax Continued. Should not break the game but will disable all Parallax support in KSS2
   - Komplexity (not compatible with the KSS2 contract system)
   - Mods not mentioned in this list have not been verified and might or might not work. Install at your own risk, there's no support for these.
   - Homeswitch and Galaxy mode are **NOT** currently supported.

## Gameplay and Features:
### Contracts System:
KSS2 features a custom contract system for **Career Mode** players. Once the KSC is upgraded, mid- and late-game contracts will become available, guiding players to explore more exciting aspects of KSS2.


### Visual and Performance Tips:
- Set **Texture Quality** to the highest setting to avoid graphical issues like black orbs for some planets.
- **Maneuver Tool Bug**: The KSP 1.12 maneuver planner may cause issues with scene loads or timewarp in modified systems. It's recommended to disable the tool or use the **Community Fixes** mod, which addresses these problems.
