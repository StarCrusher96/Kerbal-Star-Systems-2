**Kerbal Star Systems 2** (KSS2) is a massive interstellar expansion for *Kerbal Space Program*, pushing exploration far beyond Kerbol with rich, *handcrafted* star systems, some grounded in real astronomy, others purely fantastical.

As the spiritual successor to **KSS1** and **Galaxies Unbound**, KSS2 blends scientific plausibility with creative worldbuilding to deliver one of the most ambitious experiences ever made for KSP. It continues a journey that began in 2015, building on a legacy of past projects that have inspired a whole new generation of planet modders.

## ⚖️ Clarification on Past Issues

<details>
<summary> ➜  Click to read: Texture Review & Asset Clarification</summary>

<br>

> ⚠️ After public concerns were raised by Mrpasta44 (creator of Techo’s Stock Planet Revamp), all planet textures in KSS2 were carefully reviewed.
The accusation that KSS2 "stole" textures is misleading. In a few very early cases, small, layered snippets from Techo’s assets were unintentionally used. These were quickly removed or remade once I became aware. This was not some “cover-up,” but simply fixing things the moment I learned of them.
>  
> Unfortunately, instead of reaching out for dialogue, the situation was turned into public drama. I did attempt to contact the creator directly at the time, but no response other than the Reddit post we all know. I acknowledge my first public reply could have been better, but I also acted immediately: over 90% of KSS2’s textures were remade or redesigned from scratch, far beyond what was required. This not only resolved the matter, but made the project stronger.
>  
> Despite that, the same accusations are being repeated months later. At this point, the actual issue has long been resolved. What remains is someone intentionally keeping the conflict alive, and that speaks for itself.

> Addendum:
Per persistent request by Mrpasta44, we apologize publicly for any inconvenience. I never intended for this to happen, and I acted immediately to correct it once I became aware. However, given the severity of the threats we received, I believe we (me and the KSS2 team) have already done more than enough to fix things. If cooperation and dialogue had been chosen from the start, this entire situation could have been resolved quickly and respectfully. This will be our final word on the matter.

> 🤖 **About AI Tools**: I use Photoshop Generative Fill, Grand Designer, and Substance Designer to speed up detailing and iteration.  
> These tools help generate visual ideas, but the final assets are original or made with properly licensed resources.

> KSS2 remains committed to transparency, originality, and respect for other creators’ work.

## 🤝 A Note from the Creator 👑

<details>
<summary> ➜ Click to read my full statement</summary>

<br>

👋 Hi there, and thanks for reading.  
Whether you’re a long-time player, a newcomer curious about KSS2, or just passing by, I appreciate you taking the time to hear my side of the story.

> 🛠️ **KSS2 is a passion project.**  
> I’ve been part of this community for over 10 years, building things I’m proud to share with others.  
> I don’t do it for fame, attention, or conflict. I do it because I genuinely enjoy creating something ambitious for players to explore.  
>  
> Along the way, I’ve also contributed to, tested, and supported some of the more well-known standard mods that many players still use today.  
> I’ve been around for a long time, and while I don’t enjoy the drama that sometimes comes with modding, I still care deeply about the creative side of this community.  
>  
> I’ll be the first to admit I haven’t always reacted the right way. Like anyone, I’ve made mistakes — especially when things got heated.  
> But my intentions have always been honest. I want to build something meaningful, learn from the past, and grow as a creator.  
>  
> There are three incidents that often get brought up. I want to address them openly:  
>  
> • **First, about 8 years ago**, I used some assets without fully understanding how licenses worked.  
>   I didn’t know better at the time, and I’ve made sure to educate myself since.  
>  
> • **Second, the Blalo texture case.**  
>   I used a texture I had permission to include. Later, the creator revoked that permission because they were going to publish it in a book.  
>   I respected that decision and removed it, but the situation was twisted into a claim that I had stolen the asset.  
>  
> • **Third, the "Techo" issue.**  
>   A few minor texture snippets ended up sampled into KSS2.  
>   This was never about stealing an entire mod, and that was never my intention.  
>   What made it worse was how it unfolded: a public Reddit call-out without anyone ever contacting me first.  
>   No message, no discussion — just immediate outrage.  
>  
> I’m not someone who enjoys drama. I believe problems are best solved privately and respectfully.  
> I understand that public call-outs have become more common in recent years, especially with younger creators, but that’s not how I operate.  
>  
> In fact, I’ve contacted other modders privately in the past when I noticed clear violations or issues.  
> I didn’t post about it or try to ruin anyone’s reputation. I simply reached out and had a conversation.  
> That’s how I believe conflicts should be handled.  
>  
> Of course, no long-term project is perfect.  
> But when concerns have come up, I’ve done what I think any reasonable person would do.  
> I explained, listened, corrected things, and personally contacted everyone whose work might have been involved.  
>  
> Unfortunately, many of the people behind the accusations never replied.  
> They ignored my messages and chose instead to stir up hate and misinformation.  
>  
> The core KSS2 team consists of adults with full-time jobs.  
> We’re not constantly online and we don’t follow every thread.  
> Naturally, our public interaction has decreased over time.  
> But our passion for this mod has not.  
> Even after all these years, we still genuinely enjoy working on it.  
>  
> Sadly, the project has also become the target of things no hobby modder should have to deal with.  
> I’m talking about death threats, coordinated smear campaigns, hate servers, and even harassment of players who simply mention using the mod.  
> That kind of behavior speaks for itself.  
>  
> It’s easy to pick on KSS2, but plenty of other large mods have had similar or worse issues without facing this level of scrutiny.  
>  
> The claim that KSS2 "only exists because of stolen work" is simply not true.  
> Anyone who has actually played the mod or looked at its scope can see the creativity and care that went into it.  
>  
> And if you don’t like the style or think the ideas are uninspired, that’s fine.  
> Make your own mod. Do better.  
> That’s how some of the best things in this community have come to life.  
>  
> As for the reuploads of my older content, yes, I had them taken down *legally* because they violated clear license terms.  
> That wasn’t revenge. That was simply copyright being enforced the right way.  
>  
> I’m always open to feedback.  
> I’ve never shut the door on good-faith discussion.  
> But I won’t engage with drama or reward bad-faith attacks.  
>  
> Despite everything, I still believe in this community.  
> I’ve seen its creativity, its passion, and the way strange little ideas can evolve into something unforgettable.  
> That’s why I’m still here.  
>  
> I’m not the same modder I was a decade ago, and KSS2 isn’t the same mod either.  
> We’ve both grown a lot.  
>  
> If you’re curious, try the mod.  
> If you have ideas, share them.  
> If you’ve got feedback, message me.  
> Let’s build something awesome, together.  
>  
> **And let’s remember, this is a silly space game about launching frogs into the abyss, not a company.**  
>
