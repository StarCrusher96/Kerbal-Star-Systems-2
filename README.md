**Kerbal Star Systems 2** (KSS2) is a massive interstellar expansion for *Kerbal Space Program*, pushing exploration far beyond Kerbol with rich, *handcrafted* star systems, some grounded in real astronomy, others purely fantastical.

As the spiritual successor to **KSS1** and **Galaxies Unbound**, KSS2 blends scientific plausibility with creative worldbuilding to deliver one of the most ambitious experiences ever made for KSP. It continues a journey that began in 2015, building on a legacy of past projects that have inspired a whole new generation of planet modders.

## ⚖️ Clarification on Past Issues

> ⚠️ Following public concerns from *Mrpasta44*, the creator of [Techo’s Stock Planet Revamp](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/219196-techos-stock-planet-revamp-v010/), all planet textures in KSS2 were carefully reviewed.  
> I acknowledge that the situation escalated more than it should have. My initial response was not ideal. That was my mistake. The issue has been addressed and resolved.  
> Over 90% of planet textures in KSS2 were remade or redesigned. This was not just a fix. It was a full creative overhaul and reaffirmation of the mod’s identity.

> 🔹 A comet tail texture originally based on a Kcalbeloh asset was also replaced immediately once identified. The replacement was fully in line with licensing.

> 🤖 **About AI Tools**: I use Photoshop Generative Fill, Grand Designer, and Substance Designer to speed up detailing and iteration. These tools help generate visual ideas, but the final assets are original or made with properly licensed resources.

> Mistakes were made. I’ve been transparent and have worked hard to ensure that everything I release is fully original or used within the proper scope.

KSS2 remains committed to transparency, originality, and respect for other creators’ work.

> 🛠️ KSS2 is a hobby project, built on more than 10 years of KSP modding experience. I work on it in my free time, not for fame or drama, but because I enjoy it.  
> Mistakes can happen in any long-term creative effort. What matters is how we respond to them. I welcome constructive feedback and remain open to resolving issues privately or respectfully.  
> This is a game and a community. Let’s keep it fun.
