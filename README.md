# 🌌 Kerbal Star Systems 2
Kerbal Star Systems 2 (KSS2) is a massive interstellar planet pack for Kerbal Space Program, made for players who explored the stock system, pushed past the Outer Planets, and started wondering what _comes after_ that.

KSS2 sends your space program beyond familiar space into fully original star systems inspired by real astrophysics, bad ideas, and the Kerbal method of learning by catastrophic failure. Expect unfamiliar suns, hostile atmospheres, tight orbits, and planets that absolutely refuse to cooperate.

Interstellar distances turn small mistakes into expensive lessons, and long missions have a talent for revealing design flaws only after you’re already committed. Planning helps. Overengineering helps more.

Rather than going big for the sake of it or making false promises, KSS2 focuses on star systems that feel intentional. Visuals, planetary behavior, and gameplay challenge are designed together, rewarding bold exploration, creative problem-solving, and the occasional rapid unscheduled disassembly.

Actively developed and built by one of the longest-active KSP modders, KSS2 aims to be stable, ambitious, and very difficult to break; unless you’re really trying.

_Leave Kerbol behind and enjoy breaking new star systems._

## 🎯 Why Play KSS2?

- Go beyond Kerbol into fully original star systems, handcrafted with real science and unmistakable Kerbal weirdness.
- Explore where others haven’t, with interstellar mechanics, late-game progression, and systems that pioneered features now common in large KSP mods.
- Discover worlds that feel alive, with dynamic atmospheres, clouds, auroras, and stellar phenomena that keep surprising you.
- Built to last, refined over years of iteration, optimized for performance, and still pushing new ideas forward.

## 🌠 Included Star Systems  
_All systems are original creations. They take cues from real space, then the Kerbals made them… stranger._

| In-game System | Inspiration | Short Description |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Aethera** | TRAPPIST-1 | A tiny red dwarf with planets packed so close you could almost wave at the neighbors. Expect tides, heat traps, and tight orbits. |
| **Nova Kirbani** | Alpha Centauri (A+B) + Proxima | A three-star family: one bright, one steady, one grumpy and flaring. Plenty of worlds caught in their long, complicated dance. |
| **Kormin** | Luhman 16A | A glowing brown dwarf that refuses to behave like a proper star. Warm light, weird seasons, and planets that never quite cool off. |
| **Seereon** | Sirius | A very bright star with a very dense companion. Great for navigation, less great for anything that melts easily. |
| **Orbel** | Pollux | A puffed-up giant star past its prime, slowly cooking its planets into new and exciting shapes. |
| **Kerr** | Galactic Center / Sag A* | A black-hole system where physics cries a little. Extreme gravity, strange lights, and hazards Kerbals definitely weren’t meant to visit. |
| **Pandor Expansion** | Pandora (Avatar (franchise) | Adds a lush, bioluminescent Pandora-analogue moon orbiting the gas giant around Nova Kirbani A. Beautiful, hostile, and rich in scientific rewards. |
| **Red Blalo Expansion** | Crimsica (Helldivers 2) | Reimagines Blalo (Nova Kirbani B System) as its heavily debated red variant, with more oxidized terrain and altered red oceans. |

## 🔭 Roadmap (In Development)

- **Orbel & Seereon Completion**  
  Finalizing the Orbel giant system and the Seereon binary, expanding existing worlds with additional planets, moons, and late-stage stellar evolution effects. *(In active development)*

- **Pulsar System**  
  A high-risk, high-reward system built around an active pulsar, featuring extreme radiation, relativistic visuals, and environments Kerbals were never meant to survive.

- **Outer Planets & Kerbol Revamp**  
  Adds new gas giants and icy moons beyond Eeloo while modernizing the Kerbol system with updated visuals, balance tweaks, and improved exploration gameplay.
