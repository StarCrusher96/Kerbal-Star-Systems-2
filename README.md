# 🌌 Kerbal Star Systems 2 \[v3.0.1]

**Kerbal Star Systems 2** (KSS2) is a massive interstellar expansion for *Kerbal Space Program*, pushing exploration far beyond Kerbol with rich, handcrafted star systems, some grounded in real astronomy, others purely fantastical.

As the spiritual successor to **KSS1** and **Galaxies Unbound**, KSS2 blends scientific plausibility with creative worldbuilding to deliver one of the most ambitious experiences ever made for KSP. It continues a journey that began in 2015, building on a legacy of past projects that have inspired a whole new generation of planet modders.

## ⚖️ Transparency & Response to Concerns

> ⚠️ Following the *public* concerns from *Mrpasta44*, the creator of [**Techo’s Stock Planet Revamp**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/219196-techos-stock-planet-revamp-v010/), every planet texture in KSS2 has been carefully reviewed.
> While the situation was escalated with hostility, I acknowledge the oversight and also recognize that I made mistakes in how I initially responded. I sincerely regret the confusion this caused. The issue has since been fully addressed and resolved.
> In response, and as a way to reaffirm my dedication and capabilities as a planet modder, I chose to remake or redesign over 90% of all planets in KSS2. What followed was not just a fix, but a complete creative overhaul that strengthened the mod and its artistic identity.

> 🔹 Similarly, the use of a comet tail texture from Kcalbeloh System as a base for KSS2 was addressed immediately once brought to my attention, even though it continues to be mentioned. The assets were promptly replaced in full accordance with the original mod’s licensing.

KSS2 remains committed to transparency, originality, and respect for other creators’ work.

> 🛠️ KSS2 is a passion-driven hobby project, built on over a decade of experience in the KSP modding community. Mistakes can happen in any long-term creative effort. But what matters is how we handle them.
> We welcome respectful feedback and are always open to addressing concerns privately or constructively. However, **public name-calling, witch-hunting, blackmail, or spreading false narratives is unproductive and childish**. But let’s not pretend we’re running a company here. This is a game, a community, and a shared passion. KSP should stay **fun**.
