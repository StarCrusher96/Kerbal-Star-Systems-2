# 🌌 Kerbal Star Systems 2
**Kerbal Star Systems 2 (KSS2)** is a large interstellar planet pack for Kerbal Space Program, built for players who have explored the stock system, pushed past the Outer Planets, and started wondering what comes next.

KSS2 sends your space program far beyond familiar space into fully original star systems shaped by real astrophysics, bad ideas, and the Kerbal method of learning by catastrophic failure. Expect long transfer windows, hostile environments, tight orbital dynamics, and destinations where small design flaws only become obvious years into a mission.

Rather than chasing spectacle alone or making false promises, KSS2 focuses on systems that feel *intentional*. Visuals, planetary behavior, and gameplay challenge are designed together to reward careful planning, creative engineering, and the occasional rapid unscheduled disassembly.

Actively developed and maintained by one of the longest-active KSP modders, KSS2 aims to be stable, ambitious, and very difficult to break, unless you’re really trying.

_Leave Kerbol behind and enjoy breaking new star systems._

## 🌠 Included Star Systems
_All systems are original creations. They take cues from real space, then the Kerbals made them… stranger._

<details>
<summary><strong>Included Systems Overview</strong></summary>

| In-game System | Inspiration | Description |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Aethera** | TRAPPIST-1 | A compact red dwarf with tightly packed worlds, extreme tides, and unforgiving environments. |
| **Nova Kirbani** | Alpha Centauri (A+B) + Proxima | A three-star family with complex dynamics and worlds locked in a slow gravitational dance. |
| **Kormin** | Luhman 16A | A glowing brown dwarf that refuses to behave like a proper star. Dim warmth, strange worlds, and planets that never quite cool off. |
| **Seereon** | Sirius | A brilliant star with a dense companion, excellent for navigation, less great for anything that melts easily. |
| **Orbel** | Pollux | A bloated giant star past its prime, slowly reshaping its planets through stellar evolution. |
| **Kerr** | Galactic Center / Sgr A* | A black-hole system where physics cries a little. Extreme gravity, strange light, and hazards Kerbals were never meant to face. |
| **Pandor Expansion** | Pandora (Avatar) | A lush, bioluminescent moon orbiting a gas giant around Nova Kirbani A. Beautiful, hostile, and scientifically rewarding. |
| **Red Blalo Expansion** | Crimsica (Helldivers 2) | A debated red variant of Blalo, featuring oxidized terrain and altered crimson oceans. |
