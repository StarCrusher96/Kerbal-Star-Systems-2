## ‚ú® What is KSS2?

**Kerbal Star Systems 2** (KSS2) takes *Kerbal Space Program* beyond the edge of Kerbol into a galaxy of handcrafted star systems, each with its own story, dangers, and discoveries.  

As the spiritual successor to **KSS1** and **Galaxies Unbound**, it builds on a decade-long legacy of pushing KSP further than ever imagined. But KSS2 is more than just a planet pack, it‚Äôs designed for **late-game progression**: interstellar travel, long-term missions, and unique challenges that test both engineering and imagination.  

From enduring the violent flares of red dwarfs, to exploring lush habitable moons, and confronting the extremes around black holes, KSS2 offers new goals, new frontiers, and new reasons to keep playing long after stock KSP is complete.

### üéØ Why Play KSS2?

- New detailed star systems, planetary bodies, and celestial phenomena to explore  
- Late-game progression and contracts to give purpose beyond stock systems  
- Immersive visuals & atmospheres to enhance exploration

## ‚öñÔ∏è Appendix: Clarification & Statement

<details> <summary> ‚ûú Click to read: Texture Review & Asset Clarification</summary> <br>

>‚ö†Ô∏è After public concerns via Reddit were raised by Mrpasta44 (creator of Techo‚Äôs Stock Planet Revamp), all planet textures in KSS2 were carefully reviewed.
A few very early snippets of his assets were unintentionally used. These were removed or remade immediately once identified. This was not a ‚Äúcover-up‚Äù, it was resolution.
>
>I attempted direct contact at the time, but received no reply which I understand. My first public response could have been better, but I acted immediately: over 90% of KSS2‚Äôs textures were remade from scratch, far beyond what was required.
>
>Despite this, accusations are being repeated months later. The issue has long been resolved. What remains is people intentionally keeping the conflict alive, that speaks for itself.

>Addendum:
Per persistent request by Mrpasta44, we apologize publicly for any inconvenience. I never intended for this to happen, and I acted immediately to correct it once I became aware. However, given the severity of the threats we received and how we were treated, I believe we (me and the KSS2 team) have already done more than enough to fix things. If cooperation and dialogue had been chosen from the start, this entire situation could have been resolved quickly and respectfully. This will be our final word on the matter.

>ü§ñ About AI Tools: Photoshop Generative Fill, Grand Designer, and Substance Designer are used for detailing and iteration. Final assets are original or licensed.

>KSS2 remains committed to transparency, originality, and respect for other creators‚Äô work.
