# 🌌 Kerbal Star Systems 2
Kerbal Star Systems 2 (KSS2) is a large interstellar planet pack for Kerbal Space Program, built for players who explored the stock system, pushed past the Outer Planets, and started wondering what comes next.

KSS2 sends your space program far beyond familiar space into fully original star systems, shaped by real astrophysics, bad ideas, and the Kerbal method of learning by catastrophic failure. Expect long transfer windows, hostile environments, tight orbital dynamics, and destinations where small design flaws only become obvious years into a mission.

Rather than chasing spectacle alone or making false promises, KSS2 focuses on systems that feel intentional. Visuals, planetary behavior, and gameplay challenge are designed together to reward careful planning, creative engineering, and the occasional rapid unscheduled disassembly.

Actively developed and built by one of the longest-active KSP modders (over a decade), KSS2 aims to be stable, ambitious, and very difficult to break; unless you’re really trying.

_Leave Kerbol behind and enjoy breaking new star systems._

## 🌠 Included Star Systems  
_All systems are original creations. They take cues from real space, then the Kerbals made them… stranger._

<details> <summary><strong>Included Systems Overview</strong></summary>

| In-game System | Inspiration | Short Description |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Aethera** | TRAPPIST-1 | A compact red dwarf with tightly packed worlds, extreme tides, and unforgiving environments. |
| **Nova Kirbani** | Alpha Centauri (A+B) + Proxima |A three-star family with complex dynamics, and worlds caught in a slow gravitational dance. |
| **Kormin** | Luhman 16A | A glowing brown dwarf that refuses to behave like a proper star. Warm faint light, weird worlds, and planets that never quite cool off. |
| **Seereon** | Sirius | A very bright star with a very dense companion. Great for navigation, less great for anything that melts easily. |
| **Orbel** | Pollux | A puffed-up giant star past its prime, slowly cooking its planets into new and exciting shapes. |
| **Kerr** | Galactic Center / Sag A* | A black-hole system where physics cries a little. Extreme gravity, strange lights, and hazards Kerbals definitely weren’t meant to visit. |
| **Pandor Expansion** | Pandora (Avatar (franchise) | Adds a lush, bioluminescent Pandora-analogue moon orbiting the gas giant around Nova Kirbani A. Beautiful, hostile, and rich in scientific rewards. |
| **Red Blalo Expansion** | Crimsica (Helldivers 2) | Reimagines Blalo (Nova Kirbani B System) as its heavily debated red variant, with more oxidized terrain and altered red oceans. |

## 🔭 Roadmap
  
- **Orbel & Seereon Completion**  
  Finalizing the Orbel giant system and the Seereon binary, expanding existing worlds with additional planets, moons, and late-stage stellar evolution effects. *(In active development)*

- **Pulsar System**  
  A high-risk, high-reward system built around an active pulsar, featuring extreme radiation, relativistic visuals, and environments Kerbals were never meant to survive.

- **Outer Planets & Kerbol Revamp**  
  Adds new gas giants and icy moons beyond Eeloo while modernizing the Kerbol system with updated visuals, balance tweaks, and improved exploration gameplay.
