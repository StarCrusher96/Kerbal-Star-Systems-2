# 🌌 Kerbal Star Systems 2
**Kerbal Star Systems 2 (KSS2)** is an interstellar expansion that takes *Kerbal Space Program* beyond Kerbol and into the stars.  
Explore the twin suns of Nova Kirbani, descend through the burning skies of Vespin, or walk beneath the asparagus-tree forests of Blalo.  

Every system in KSS2 is built with **scientific precision, artistic direction, and gameplay depth**, creating a universe where exploration feels meaningful and discovery truly rewarding.  

Developed by one of KSP’s most experienced world-builders, **KSS2** draws on over a decade of creativity and refinement, a defining project in interstellar design that continues to inspire while remaining true to its own vision.  
Original in concept, uncompromising in quality, and unmistakably **Kerbal**.

---

## 🎯 Why Play KSS2?

- **Venture beyond Kerbol**, travel to entirely new star systems, each handcrafted with care, science, and imagination.  
- **Experience true progression**, uncover late-game missions, ancient anomalies, and interstellar challenges that reward curiosity and persistence.  
- **Lose yourself in the atmosphere**, dynamic clouds, auroras, wormholes, and stars bring each world to life.  
- **Built for players, refined by experience**, optimized for both beauty and performance, shaped by over a decade of worldbuilding and community passion.

## 🌠 Included Star Systems  
_All systems are original creations. They take cues from real space, then the Kerbals made them… stranger._

| In-game System | Inspiration | Short Description |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Aethera** | TRAPPIST-1 | A tiny red dwarf with planets packed so close you could almost wave at the neighbors. Expect tides, heat traps, and tight orbits. |
| **Nova Kirbani** | Alpha Centauri (A+B) + Proxima | A three-star family: one bright, one steady, one grumpy and flaring. Plenty of worlds caught in their long, complicated dance. |
| **Kormin** | Luhman 16A | A glowing brown dwarf that refuses to behave like a proper star. Warm light, weird seasons, and planets that never quite cool off. |
| **Seereon** | Sirius | A very bright star with a very dense companion. Great for navigation, less great for anything that melts easily. |
| **Orbel** | Pollux | A puffed-up giant star past its prime, slowly cooking its planets into new and exciting shapes. |
| **Kerr** | Galactic Center / Sag A* | A black-hole system where physics cries a little. Extreme gravity, strange lights, and hazards Kerbals definitely weren’t meant to visit. |
| **Kerbol** _soon_ | Sol | The familiar home system polished up, tuned a bit, but still the same old warm ball Kerbals yell at during launch. |
