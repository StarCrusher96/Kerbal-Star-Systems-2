# 🌌 Kerbal Star Systems 2 \[v3.0.1]

**Kerbal Star Systems 2** (KSS2) is a massive interstellar expansion for *Kerbal Space Program*, pushing exploration far beyond Kerbol with rich, handcrafted star systems, some grounded in real astronomy, others purely fantastical.

As the spiritual successor to **KSS1** and **Galaxies Unbound**, KSS2 blends scientific plausibility with creative worldbuilding to deliver one of the most ambitious experiences ever made for KSP. Building on a legacy of past projects that have inspired a whole new generation of planet modders.
