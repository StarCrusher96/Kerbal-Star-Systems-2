**Kerbal Star Systems 2** (KSS2) is a massive interstellar expansion for *Kerbal Space Program*, pushing exploration far beyond Kerbol with rich, *handcrafted* star systems, some grounded in real astronomy, others purely fantastical.

As the spiritual successor to **KSS1** and **Galaxies Unbound**, KSS2 blends scientific plausibility with creative worldbuilding to deliver one of the most ambitious experiences ever made for KSP. It continues a journey that began in 2015, building on a legacy of past projects that have inspired a whole new generation of planet modders.

## ⚖️ Clarification on Past Issues

> ⚠️ After public concerns were raised by Mrpasta44, the creator of Techo’s Stock Planet Revamp, all planet textures in KSS2 were carefully reviewed.
The accusation that KSS2 "stole" textures is misleading. In a few early cases, small, layered snippets from Techo’s assets were unintentionally used. These were quickly removed or remade once I became aware, even though I was never contacted directly.
Unfortunately, things escalated into drama before any real conversation could happen. I acknowledge that my first public response could have been better, and I’ve taken that to heart.
In response, I went above and beyond what was necessary: over 90% of KSS2’s textures were remade or redesigned from scratch. Not just to fix things, but to strengthen the mod's creative identity and quality.

> 🔹 A comet tail texture originally based on a Kcalbeloh asset was also replaced immediately once identified. The replacement was fully in line with licensing.

> 🤖 **About AI Tools**: I use Photoshop Generative Fill, Grand Designer, and Substance Designer to speed up detailing and iteration. These tools help generate visual ideas, but the final assets are original or made with properly licensed resources.

KSS2 remains committed to transparency, originality, and respect for other creators’ work.

## 🤝 A Note from the Creator👑

> 🛠️ **KSS2 is a passion project.** I’ve been part of this community for over 10 years, building things I’m proud to share with others. I don’t do it for fame, attention, or conflict. I do it because I genuinely enjoy creating something ambitious for players to explore.  
>  
> Of course, no long-term project is perfect. But when concerns have come up, I’ve done what any reasonable person would: I reached out, explained, listened, and made improvements. I personally contacted every creator whose content might have been affected. I took the time to correct mistakes, open dialogue, and act respectfully.  
>  
> Meanwhile, many of the people behind the accusations never replied. They ignored my messages, refused to talk, and instead chose to stir up hate.  
>  
> The core devs behind KSS2 are adults with day jobs. We’re not hyper-online, and we’re not monitoring every single conversation. Our interaction with the community has naturally decreased over time. But even after all these years, we still genuinely enjoy working on this mod, just like we did a decade ago. That hasn’t changed.  
>  
> Sadly, this project has become the target of behavior no hobby mod deserves: death threats, smear attempts, hate servers, and harassment of people who simply post about using it. That kind of behavior speaks for itself.  
>  
> It’s easy to pick on KSS2, but there are plenty of other "famous" mods with similar or worse issues that never face the same level of scrutiny.  
>  
> The claim that KSS2 “only exists because of stolen work” is simply false. Anyone who actually plays the mod, or even just looks at its scale and scope, can see the care, creativity, and originality behind it.  
>  
> And if you don’t like the style, or think the ideas are bland or uninspired, then by all means, **make your own mod and do better**. That’s how the best things in this community are made.  
>  
> As for the reuploads of my older content: yes, they were taken down ! *legally* ! due to clear license/copyright violations. These weren’t acts of retaliation. They were standard copyright actions, taken through the proper frameworks.  
>  
> I’m open to feedback. I always have been. But I won’t take part in drama. I won’t reward bad-faith attacks.  
>  
> This is supposed to be fun. This is supposed to be a community where we build cool things together.  
>  
> **Let’s remember this is a silly space game about launching frogs into the abyss, not a company.**  
>
